### Summary

The University of Florida's (UF) Stan Mayfield Demonstration Biorefinery (hereafter, the Biorefinery), funded in-part by a $20 million appropriation from the Florida Legislature and a $5.4 million grant from the United States Department of Agriculture & Department of Energy, allowed UF researchers to study the most effective ways to convert sugarcane and sorghum agricultural residues into cellulosic ethanol, with the aim of reducing the United State's dependence on imported fossil fuels, helping consumers save money, preserving natural resources, and mitigating climate change.

The Biorefinery, located in Perry, FL, was a fully integrated, continuous process that included feedstock handling (3-5 dry tons per day), dilute acid steam preatreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis (5,000 gal), fermentation (30,000 gal), distillation, dehydration, and liquid/solid separation. It was in operation between 2012-2016, before being decomissioned and shutdown. The project resulted in numerous patents and publications.

The UF Board of Trustees named the facility for Stan Mayfield, a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 2000 until his death in 2008. An alumnus of UF’s College of Engineering, Mayfield was a leader in education and environmental issues. As chairman of the Florida House’s Environmental and Natural Resources Council, he championed energy research, including funding for the Biorefinery.

Much of the Biorefinery's research was based on the work of Dr. Lonnie Ingram, UF distinguished professor of microbiology and cell science, director of the Florida Center for Renewable Chemicals and Fuels, and member of the National Academy of Sciences.
