2/4/2015,JS,Assembled and installed,Assembled and installed,The Trueline resurfaced ball valves and metal seats were installed for the first time | One ball was original but with resurfacing the other ball was completely new with resurfacing | The original ball was installed as the top valve and there was some slop evident in the actuator key | The top valve was installed with the double acting ACTREG actuator and the bottom valve was installed the singe acting (made double) spring loaded actuator | All new O-rings were installed | During operation the top valve was found to close very slowly (10-11 s) and open normally (3-4 s) | The bottom valve opened and closed normally (3-4 s)
2/12/2015,JS,Closing very slowly,Closing well,It was thought that the solenoid was the reason why the top valve was closing so slowly | The solenoid from the bottom was replaced with the top but it did not help much | The back-up spring loaded actuator should probably be installed in place of the double acting to solve the problem
2/13/2015,KW,Closing very slowly,Closing well,Could not get the top valve to close in the allotted time | Removed the acutator and tested if the problem was the actuator or the ball valve | Still moved slowly so started removing the air lines and found a clog from a piece of aluminum | Reinstalled the acutator in the open position with the ball valve in the closed position | Once engaged the acutator sheared off a marker stud | Rotated the ball valve into the correct posistion and operated fine from there
3/30/2015,JS,See notes,NA,The actuator (double acting act-reg) diaphragm ruptured and is permanently non-functional | This same thing happened to our other doubling acting actuator | The manufacturer is affiliated with Trueline | Going to investigate if we can get any money back
