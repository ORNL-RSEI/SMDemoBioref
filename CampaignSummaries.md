# Campaign Summaries

## University of Florida's Stan Mayfield Demonstration Biorefinery

The Stan Mayfield Biorefinery conducted a series of campaigns during the four years it was in operation. Each campaign involved continuous operation and processing of either sugarcane bagasse or sorghum bagasse into cellulosic ethanol, typically lasting 7-10 days in length. A total of 23 campaigns were conducted to assess different variables and ultiamtely optimize the bioprocess. At the end of each campaign, process engineers would provide a summary for internal documentation and grant reporting purposes.  

Campaign Summaries are typically comprised of multiple documents, including:  

* Operations Summary: A generalized summary of the conditions and outcomes of the campaign.  
* Problems & Resolutions: A synopsis of the problems and challenges that arose during operation and the subsequent steps taken to overcome them.  
* Log Book: A detailed list of actions and notes taken in chronological order during the multi-day campaign. Keys to color codings and abbreviations can be found at the end of each log and in [LB_keys.pdf](CS/LB/LB_keys.pdf).

Key information for each campaign are condensed into the following sections:

* Time Period
* Goals
* Conditions
* Changes
* Milestones

Note: Significant downtime was often experienced between campaigns owing to the small number of employees and/or delays in equipment repairs.

*Milestones*

1. 2.5% enzyme used during liquefaction
